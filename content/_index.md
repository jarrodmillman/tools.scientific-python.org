We maintain a collection of tools, small and large, that help projects across the ecosystem.
All tools:

- are owned and developed by the community, for the community;
- provide functionality needed by projects across the ecosystem;
- are released under the liberal [3-Clause BSD](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/) or [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) license;
- attribute copyright to `Scientific Python Developers`;
- follow our [Code of Conduct](https://scientific-python.org/code_of_conduct/); and
- are hosted in the [Scientific Python GitHub Organization](https://github.com/scientific-python/).

We also list a few hosted services provided for the community.

If you have an existing tool that you would like to host and maintain as part of the Scientific Python project,
please [create a New Topic](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/new-topic?category=contributor&tags=propose)
describing your tool, its target audience, and its developer community.

We only host tools that are actively maintained, and will give your existing
developer community full access to continue managing your repository.

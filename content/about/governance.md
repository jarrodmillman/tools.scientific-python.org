# Abstract

The Scientific Python Tools and Services is a consensus-based community project.
Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design,
and participate in the decision making process.
This document describes how that participation takes place, how to find consensus, and how
deadlocks are resolved.

## Roles And Responsibilities

The Scientific Python Tools and Services has the following roles and responsibilities.

### Community Members

The Scientific Python Tools and Services community consists of anyone contributing to our tools or services
as well as commenting on and reviewing contributions to our tools and services..
Community members must adhere to our
[code of conduct](https://scientific-python.org/code_of_conduct/).

### Individual Tools and Services Maintainers

Individual Tools and Services Maintainers are community members that have demonstrated continued
commitment to specific tools or services through ongoing contributions.

Maintainers are responsible for reviewing PRs to specific tools repository or maintaining specific services.
They have maintainer rights.

New Individual Tools and Services Maintainers can by any existing maintainer of those specific tools or services.

### Tools Team

Tools Team Members are maintainers that have demonstrated continued commitment to
the the overall project through ongoing contributions.


Tools Team Members are responsible for accepting new tools and services, 

reviewing blog submissions to the blog repository.
They have triage rights.

A new Tools Team Member can be nominated by any existing Tools Team Members.
Discussion about new  Tools Team Members nominations is one of the few
activities that takes place on the Tools Team Members' private management forum.
The decision to invite a new Tools Team Member must be made by "lazy consensus",
meaning unanimous agreement by all responding existing Tools Team Members.
Invitation must take place at least one week after initial nomination,
to allow existing members time to voice objections.

## Decision Making Process

The Tools Team uses a _consensus seeking_ process for making decisions.
The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among team members.
Editors are expected to distinguish between fundamental objections to a proposal and minor
perceived flaws that they can live with, and not hold up the decision making process for the latter.
If no option can be found without an objection, the decision is escalated to the
[Scientific Python Community Leaders](https://scientific-python.org/about/#community-leaders).
